# Social-Tournament-Helper v0.1

This Google Chrome browser plugin helps to convert avatars and emojis into Social Tournament Coins. If you are on www.socialtournaments.com/en/collections/ a white panel is shown in the upper right corner.

Features:

- Panel shows how many avatars can be converted in total
- The button "Convert Avatars" automaticly converts avatars & emojis into coins
- The button "Stop" stops the conversion process

 Known errors:

- The number of convertible avatars updates only after refreshing the website
- The popup window after successful conversion does not close automatically
- If an avatar exists e.g. 3x the plugin always converts only 1 avatar
