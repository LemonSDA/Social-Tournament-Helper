## Known Issues

1. **The Number of Convertible Avatars Updates Only After Refreshing the Website**
   - The extension currently updates the count of convertible avatars only after refreshing the website. This means that if avatars are converted, the count won't automatically decrease. You may need to manually refresh the page to see the updated count.

2. **The Popup Window After Successful Conversion Does Not Close Automatically**
   - After successfully converting avatars, the popup window does not close automatically. You will need to close it manually once it's done.

3. **If an Avatar Exists Multiple Times, the Plugin Always Converts Only 1 Avatar**
   - If an avatar exists multiple times in the collection, the plugin currently converts only one instance of it. It does not automatically convert all identical avatars in one go.

Please note that these are known issues, and the extension's functionality is limited by its current implementation. Future updates may address these issues and enhance the extension's performance. Your feedback and contributions to the development of the extension are welcome.
